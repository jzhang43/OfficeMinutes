# OfficeMinutes

Developed in JumboHack 2024. 

A streamlined queuing system for students to queue public/private questions, and groups up students that have similar questions during office hours. Students describe their problems with short titles and weekly-specific tags, giving course staff gain a quick insight to optimize the teaching experience.
